# Budget-Planner

This is an iOS app connected with iPhone wallet to allow users to keep track of their daily expenses and budget

I implemented  functionalities  that  include  viewing  transactions  by  category,  taking  pictures  and  showing  location  byusing Google Maps API, sorting transactions according to date, etc
Also, you can visualize the spending distribution by time, category, and location
