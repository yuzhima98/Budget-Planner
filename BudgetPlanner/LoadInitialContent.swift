     IMPORTANT NOTE: Current GPS location cannot be accurately determined under the iOS Simulator
     on your laptop or desktop computer because those computers do NOT have a GPS antenna.
     Therefore, do NOT expect the code herein to work under the iOS Simulator!
    
     You must deploy your location-aware app to an iOS device to be able to test it properly.
 
     Monitoring the user's current location is a serious privacy issue!
     You are required to get the user's permission in two ways:
    
     (1) requestWhenInUseAuthorization:
     (a) Ask your locationManager to request user's authorization while the app is being used.
     (b) Add a new row in the Info.plist file for "Privacy - Location When In Use Usage Description", for which you specify, e.g.,
     "Photo Album requires monitoring your location only when you are using the app!"
    
     (2) requestAlwaysAuthorization:
     (a) Ask your locationManager to request user's authorization even when the app is not being used.
     (b) Add a new row in the Info.plist file for "Privacy - Location Always Usage Description", for which you specify, e.g.,
     "Photo Album requires monitoring your location even when you are not using your app!"
    
     You select and use only one of these two options depending on your app's requirement.
